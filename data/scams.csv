Scam,Definition
Advance fee,"The advance-fee scam arises from many different situations: investment opportunities, money transfers, job scams, online purchases of any type and any legality, etc., but the bottom line is always the same, you're expected to pay money to receive money. So you will pay the scammer and receive nothing.

It can be as simple as the scammer asking you to pay them upfront for an item they have listed, or as complex as a drug scam that involves an initial scam site, a scam shipping site, and fake government agents. Sometimes the scammers will simply take your first payment and dissappear, but sometimes they will take your initial payment and then make excuses that lead to you making additional payments.

If you are involved in an advance-fee scam, you should attempt to dispute/chargeback any payments sent to the scammer, you should block the scammer, and you should ignore them if they attempt to contact you again. Thanks to redditor AceyAceyAcey for this script."
Amazon review,"Amazon review scammers are trying to buy 5 star reviews without looking like they’re buying 5 star reviews. A long time ago, sellers could offer free or discounted coupon codes to buyers in exchange for an “honest” review. This practice was banned in 2016, replaced by Amazon’s Vine program. FTC rules also dictate that any reviews or product promotions obtained in this way have to be clearly labeled as such. To get around both the FTC’s labeling rules and Amazon’s ban, there are websites and private Facebook groups that link together shady sellers with people willing to sell positive reviews.

These shady sellers usually sell cheap products that would otherwise not receive positive reviews (or many purchases at all) naturally. You're either asked to pay for it in full on Amazon, and be reimbursed via PayPal (which Amazon famously doesn’t use) to hide the transaction, or receive a gift card. Here’s an excellent article describing in-depth how this process works. One should never trust an Amazon (or other merchant's) review - carefully research the products they purchase instead. Of course, there’s always the chance that an Amazon Review scam is just a scam and they’ll just take your money and run. Credit to user SuwanneeValleyGirl for this script.

 "
Artist/NFT,"This is a variant of the advance fee scam. The scammer will often use a stolen social media account to increase their credibility. A scammer will contact an artist, and ask to purchase one of their works of art (paintings, digital media or photos), and they will offer a generous sum of money. It can take three forms: a fake payment email (in which you're instructed to pay some fee to receive the money), a fake check (in which you're asked to forward some money elsewhere), or a fake NFT minting scam.

In this latest variant, the scammer suggests to buy the art piece in NFT form. The victim is instructed to mint the NFT in a fake minting website, which charges money for the fuel (as any NFT minting service does). The difference is, the scammers control this fake website and run away with your money. After you mint the NFT, the scammer disappears without paying for the piece.

This is a scam where a scammer impersonates a client. For the scam where a scammer impersonates an artist, call the automoderator trigger (muse)."
Blackmail,"The exact wording of the emails varies, but there are generally four main parts. They claim to have installed a RAT (remote access trojan) or any type of software/malware after visiting a porn/adult video site, they claim to have a video of you masturbating or watching porn, they threaten to release the video to your friends/family/loved ones/boss/dog, and they demand that you pay them in order for them to delete the video.

Rest assured that this is a very common spam campaign and there is no truth behind the email or the threats. If they had a video of you, they would show it to you to prove that they have it. Here are some news articles about this scam.

There is a variant with death threats in which they will usually claim that they have been paid to kill you, and will threaten to kill you/your family if you do not pay a Bitcoin ransom. They usually also claim that they will kill your family if you report the email. The emails are spam and can be ignored."
Brushing/Direct shipping,"The scammer is creating and shipping out fake orders in order to both boost order numbers and place false verified reviews. Here is the Wikipedia page that explains brushing, and here is a news article from Forbes about the scheme. Receiving packages as part of brushing doesn't mean that your private information is compromised, if the items are relatively inexpensive.

If instead you received an expensive item, such as electronics or something like that, your account may be compromised. Log into your account and see if there are orders under your name. A scammer that has access to your account would instead be using your credit card, or a stolen credit card to purchase things in your name and ship them, and then have a porch thief pick them up from your door.

For example, when Amazon accounts are compromised, orders can be archived by the thieves to hide their tracks. Go to https://amazon.com/gp/your-account/order-history?orderFilter=archived to find any of those. If that list is clean, it means that this order didn't originate through your account."
Car sales,"If you're buying a car, a scammer will list a car on a marketplace site and will ask you to email them. They will tell you that they will ship or otherwise transport the car to you and allow you to inspect it. They may use the name of a company like eBay or Amazon to make the scam sound more legitimate. The scam is that the car does not exist, despite whatever pictures you have received, and you will be asked to pay for the car using gift cards, crypto or irreversible wire transfers..

If the seller is real and wants to actually meet, you may face a different type of scam (which involves a run down, stolen or otherwise bad deal of a car). To prevent this, you need to meet at a mechanic's shop you trust and have a full inspection of the vehicle. Remember all sales are final when dealing with used cars. The seller needs to come to meet you, so as mentioned above, the offer for a courier doesn't help.

If you're selling a car, the scammer will try to have you pay for a verification on a scam website, some VIN check lookup or certificate of records of some sort. Remember you're the seller, you set the terms. If you want to provide some certification, use a website you trust. They can do their own verification if they don't trust yours. And also, they can try to pull a fake check on you. No buyer is sending a courier to pick up a car they haven't seen.

And again, if the buyer is real and you actually sold the card, the same rule applies: all sales are final, so do the proper paperwork, consult a subreddit dedicated to car sales and make sure the transfer is completed.
"
Courier,"Courier fraud situations usually start with a phone call from a scammer who may know lots of information about you. Scammers will impersonate bank employees, police, or other government officials. They will say that your account has been linked to fraud or another crime, and will request your assistance. You'll be asked to either withdraw money, or purchase gift cards or expensive items, and you'll be directed to give the money to the scammers in some way. One thing that sets courier fraud out from other phone scams is that there is often a local connection, as victims may meet someone in real life to hand off the cash or items.
"
Crypto airdrop event,"While we usually see it advertised via modmail to moderators on Reddit, it applies to any cryptocurrency airdrop opportunity that you may encounter. Scammers use bots to mass-message moderators of subreddits, through modmail (because it can't be filtered or closed, as DMs can) to offer the unique opportunity to get their hands on a new cryptocurrency as a token of appreciation for their work as mods.

The link will bring the victim to a phishing website: a website that looks like a legitimate crypto wallet or exchange, where they're asked to connect their wallet. If you do, your wallet will be controlled by the scammer, or will make you sign a smart contract with a crypto honeypot. In any case: you lose money.

Always check the website address to which you're connecting your wallet. Don't rely on logos, colors and general aesthetics to trust the website in which you're operating. It's very easy to copy the looks of a website. The website address may look similar, but if it isn't exactly like the website advertised in official social media accounts or apps, close the tab. For example: Coinbase is coinbase.com, not coinbase.cc - DappRadar is dappradar.com, not radar-dapp.com."
Debt collection,"If you are positive the debt you're being accused of has never existed or has already been resolved, this is a scam. Keep in mind that companies can change names and debts can be sold, so not recognizing the company you owe isn't necessarily proof of a scam; you should call the company where the debt originated to confirm a debt exists. Be mindful of debt collection laws in your state or country before engaging in any conversation with a debt collection agency, to avoid being liable for debts that may be outside their statute of limitations for collections.

Like legitimate debt collectors, scam collectors may have access to your SSN, address, names of your contacts, etc. from a data breach. They may be calling your family, friends and employer relentlessly with invasive or embarrassing questions about you. They may send you threatening letters, emails and texts that state you will be sued or arrested if you don't immediately pay them X amount of dollars. These are scare tactics to rush you into paying before you have a chance to consider the situation logically. Instruct all of your contacts that this is fraud and to block the calls. If the scammers know a lot about you, you have potentially been involved in a serious data breach.

Here's a guide from r/identityTheft that covers the basics of credit freeze, IRS pins, even replacement SSN and police reports: https://www.reddit.com/r/IdentityTheft/comments/pqb1za/identity_theft_recovery_101/

You need to freeze your credit through the credit bureaus: https://www.reddit.com/r/IdentityTheft/comments/uvv3ij/psa_freezing_your_three_main_credit_reports_is/ and freeze your debit line with Chex Systems https://www.chexsystems.com/security-freeze/place-freeze

Report correctly referenced documents (SSN, drivers license, credit card) as stolen to the respective agencies. If you are unsure of how to move forward, request guidance from local law enforcement. Credit to user l0john51 for this script."
Escort/cartel death threats,"It's a very common scam, and the scammers are not affiliated with cartels or crime groups, they are simply normal scammers using a threatening script. The threats are not real, and there is no risk to your safety whatsoever. The best way to react is to simply ignore the scammer and ignore any of their other contact attempts. Here are some news reports about the scam."
Fake check,"The fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (a digital photo or a physical paper check), you deposit a check (via mobile deposit or via an ATM) and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards or crypto). Sometimes the scammers will ask you to order things through a site, but that is just another way they get your money.

Banks are legally obligated to make money available to you fast, but they can take their time to bounce it. Hence the window of time exploited by the scam. During that window of time the scammer asks you to send money back, because you are under the illusion that the funds cleared.

When the check finally bounces, the bank will take the initial deposit back, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. Here is an article from the FTC: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams, and here is an article from the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/your-money/fake-check-scam.html

If you deposited a bad check, we recommend that you notify your bank immediately."
Fake crypto wallet,"Fake cryptocurrency websites and apps controlled by scammers are becoming more and more common. Sometimes the scam begins with a romance scammer who claims that they can help the victim invest in cryptocurrency. Victims are told to buy cryptocurrency of some kind using a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange, and then they are told to send their cryptocurrency to a website wallet address where it will be invested. Sometimes the scam begins with a notice that the victim won cryptocurrency on some website, in this case messages will often be sent through Discord.

In either case, the scammer controls the website, so they make it look like there is money in the victim’s account on their website. Then the scammer (or the scammer pretending to be someone official who is associated with the website) tells the victim that they have to put more money into the website before they can get their money out of the website. Of course all of the money sent by the victim has gone directly into the scammer’s wallet, and any additional money sent by the victim to retrieve their money from the website will also go directly into the scammer’s wallet, and all of the information about money being held by the website was totally fake.

If the scammer used Bitcoin, then you can report the scammer’s Bitcoin wallet address here: https://www.bitcoinabuse.com/reports. If the scammer used Ethereum, then you can report the scammer’s Ethereum wallet address here: https://info.etherscan.com/report-address/. You can see how much cryptocurrency has been sent to the scammer’s wallet address here: https://www.blockchain.com/explorer. Thanks to redditor nimble2 for this script."
Fake payment,"The fake payment scam occurs when someone tries to trick you into thinking that you have received a legitimate payment when no such payment has been made. The most common method they use is sending you an email meant to look like a payment confirmation. In some cases the emails will be almost indistinguishable to a legitimate email sent by the payment service. Scammers are known to also show you screenshots instead of an email. Never trust a screenshot a stranger shows you, because it is probably doctored.

Scammers spoof the 'from' email to match an official address, and make you think you received a legitimate email. To combat a fake payment scam, verify online payments by logging in directly to the service. Do not check your junk folder, and do not assume a payment is legitimate based on an email alone. If a payment isn't reflected on your account and the person you are dealing with insists they have sent it, call support and ask about it. Here is an image of a scammer trying to pull off a fake payment scam. There is also a variant of the fake payment scam where you will receive a legitimate but fraudulent payment.

A variant of the fake payment email is just an advance fee scam: the scammer tries to convince you that your funds are on hold, and that you have to upgrade your account by sending the scammer some money to authorize the payment. No payment processor works like this. If you think you're dealing with a scammer, you're probably right. Always trust your gut."
Free PS5/Macbook,"This scam consists of an offer of a free video game console, a free laptop or otherwise expensive electronics posted on social media or classifieds platforms, usually on Facebook Marketplace. The scammer sometimes plays the role of a parent who lost their child, a parent who is punishing their child, or someone offering the console as a giveaway. When offering a free laptop, it's always a giveaway for students in need.

The scammer offers the item for free, and asks only to cover the shipping costs. Once you pay for the shipping, the scammer disappears with your money."
Google Calendar,"Having spam appear in your calendar does not mean that you were hacked, or that your email account is insecure or compromised in any way. Your response should be to report the event as spam/junk, and then delete the event. Here is a news article about this spam technique, here is an article about how to prevent the spam for Android users, and here is an article that contains instructions for iPhone users. Thanks to Jacajacka for this script.
"
Google Voice verificatiom,"The scammer wants to create a Google Voice account, which allows them to make free calls within the U.S. and Canada. Google Voice requires verification from a phone, so scammers trick people into verifying accounts for them. If you are currently talking to a verification code scammer, just block them and move on. If you have fallen for the scam, there are detailed instructions here that you should follow."
Influencer,"This is a dishonest marketing technique where a user will reach out to you on a social media platform, usually Instagram, and offer you the chance to work with or promote a brand. Sometimes the main brand account will reach out to you, but other times a fresh account will message you and direct you to contact the main account. Working with the brand will involve buying their products, though you may be offered a discount.

This technique is usually used by dropshipping sites that sell items from Aliexpress at inflated prices, so even with the discount they will make money from your order. This is simply a marketing technique sent to many people at once to get people to order from their site, so if you receive a message like this all you need to do is ignore it.
"
Instagram/Facebook account takeover,"This scam is a variation of the verify/pin scam. You will receive a message from someone who is asking for your help to log into their account. This message could be from a contact you trust, but the account is actually compromised. They will either ask you to add their email or phone number to your own account, or ask you to receive a verification link that you will copy and send to them. Either way, these steps will allow the scammer to change your password and lock you out of your account.

If your account was stolen there is a way of reversing that yourself. You don't need professional services and ignore anyone reaching you in private with offers of hacking it back. Those are scammers. Make an effort recovering your account. A taken over account is a tool for scammers, you want to stop that.

You can recover a Facebook or Instagram account with a simple step. Every time a scammer takes over your account, Meta will email you about it.

Read this guide from Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/help/203305893040179 which basically says that if the email address of your account has been changed, you'll receive an email from security@facebookmail.com to undo the change - If you can't find that email, visit this page and follow the steps: https://facebook.com/hacked

Read this guide from Instagram: https://help.instagram.com/368191326593075 - same as above, but the email comes from security@mail.instagram.com - If you can't find that email, visit this page and follow the steps: https://instagram.com/hacked"
iPhone Find My disabler,"This scam targets owners of stolen iPhones, which have a service called Find My: through this, iPhones are tied to the Apple ID of the user, and can be locked remotely when activating Lost Mode. Scammers will attempt to communicate with the victim by emailing or calling the phone number/email address shown on the lock screen while locked through Lost Mode, under the guise of either Apple or a person who has bought the phone and attempt to convince or pressure them to remove the Apple ID from the iPhone.

If you receive such a message, DO NOT follow the instructions to remove the device from your Apple ID. The reason they want it removed is because the thief wants to resell it on the black market for a profit, and bricked phones are worthless. Instead of removing, you're free to erase it. This will delete your personal data but will leave the device connected to your Apple ID. You can then make a police report, and also report it stolen to your phone company. The company can blacklist the IMEI so it adds a layer of protection regionally.

Any readers should take this opportunity to check if your Find My is enabled in your iPhone."
Job,"Fake job scams come in many different varieties. The scammers will usually conduct interviews over Whatsapp, Telegram or Teams. They will offer high wages for the work being done, oftentimes with wildly varied wage ranges by hour, and they will \""hire\"" you by telling you that you are hired, rather than going through the normal process that a company takes when hiring an employee in your country.

If they mention anything about a check or about receiving and sending out transactions, it is a fake check scam. If they say they will cut you a check so you can buy equipment for remote work, it's a scam in which they make you purchase equipment on a fake website under their control, with your own card, and when the check bounces in a few weeks you're left holding the bag (and the equipment never comes)

If they mention anything about receiving, processing, or inspecting packages, it is a parcel mule scam.

If they ask you to purchase items up-front, ask you to pay a fee in order to be hired, or ask you to purchase gift cards, it is an advance-fee scam. If they mention Bitcoin ATMs, it's always a scam.

If the job involves posting advertisements on Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist or eBay, they are using you and your account to scam other people (especially if it's rental listings). Thanks to redditor AceyAceyAcey for this script."
Multi level marketing,"Multi Level Marketing or MLMs for short, are a great way to lose money and friends. The vast majority of people who get involved in MLMs do not make money, and the money that is made is made by the people at the very top. Go to /r/antimlm for more information about multi-level marketing schemes.
"
Muse,"The muse scam is a variant of the fake check scam in which the scammer will contact the victim over social media and claim to want to use their image for an art project. The scammer will often use a stolen social media account to increase their credibility. They will offer a generous sum of money and offer to pay via check, and the victim is instructed to send money to the scammer for “materials” via an irreversible method. The victim is under the illusion that the funds cleared when the bank makes the money available thanks to current regulations. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months.

If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. You can summon the fake check automoderator explanation using the trigger fakecheck. Thanks to redditor aNeatHat for this script.

This is a scam where a scammer impersonates an artist. For the scam where a scammer targets artists, call the automoderator trigger (artist)
"
Parcel mule,"The parcel mule scam involves fraudsters sending you packages and you shipping them out to other people. The items are fraudulently obtained, usually with stolen credit cards, and the investigation into the fraud will lead to you rather than to the scammer. Here is the Wikipedia page for this scam: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parcel_mule_scam, and here is an article from the USPS: https://about.usps.com/publications/pub300a/pub300a_v04_revision_072019_tech_022.htm -"
Pet,"First, you will encounter a breeder who may have their own website or who may post listings on an established website. They will offer a good price for a pet with papers, however they will not be able to meet you in real life, and will only sell you the pet with the use of a shipping/courier/freight service. The scammer will demand payment via irreversible payment methods such as Cash App, Venmo, Western Union, or cryptocurrency. The websites they use are usually very easy to spot, as the domain will have been registered recently, and the images they use should be findable using reverse image search. Once you pay the scammers and they know they have you, they will demand more and more fees for things like airline insurance, crating fees, papers, import permits, etc.

If you are involved in a pet scam, you need to stop talking with the scammers and dispute any transactions that you are able to dispute. Here is an article from the AKC regarding pet scams, and here are two news articles about pet scams."
Pig butchering,"It is called pig butchering because scammers use intricate scripts to \""fatten up\"" the victim (gaining their trust over days, weeks or months) before the \""slaughter\"" (taking them for all of their money). This scam often starts with what appears to be a harmless wrong number text or message. When the victim responds to say it is the wrong number, the scammer tries to start a friendship with the victim. These conversations can be platonic or romantic in nature, but they all have the same goal- to gain the trust of the victim in order to get them ready for the crypto scam they have planned.

The scammer often claims to be wealthy and/or to have a wealthy family member who got wealthy investing in crypto currency. The victim is eventually encouraged to try out a (fake) crypto currency investment website, which will appear to show that they are earning a lot of money on their initial investment. The scammer may even encourage the victim to attempt a withdrawal that does go through, further convincing the victim that everything is legit. The victim is then pressured to invest significantly more money, even their entire net worth.

Eventually, the website will find an excuse why the account is frozen (e.g. for fraud, because supposed taxes are owed, etc) and may try to further extort the victim to give them even more money in order to gain access to the funds. By this time, the victim will never gain access and their money is gone. Many victims lose tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or even millions of dollars. Often, the scammers themselves are victims of human trafficking, performing these scams under threats of violence. If you are caught up in this scam, it is important that you do not send any more money for any reason, and contact law enforcement to report it. Thanks to user Mediocre_Airport_576 for this script.

If you know someone involved in a pig butchering scam, sit down together to watch this video by Jim Browning to help them understand what's going on: https://youtu.be/vu-Y1h9rTUs -
"
Pin verification,"You will receive a legitimate authentication text from a company like Google, Craigslist, or Microsoft, and you will also have someone else asking you for the pin. Sometimes the scam starts on Craigslist, and the scammer will ask you to verify that you are a real person, and will say that Craigslist has many scammers which is why they want to verify you. Sometimes you will receive a random authentication text, and the scammer will text you without any previous contact.

The goal of the scammer can be to verify accounts that require phone verification, verify postings that require phone authentication, or to steal your social media accounts via a password reset pin that you shouldn't share with anyone ever. Here are two articles about this scam. Thanks to redditor bmarkel123 for the script."
Recovery,"Recovery scams target people who have already fallen for a scam. The scammer may contact you, or may advertise their services online. They will usually either offer to help you recover your funds, or will tell you that your funds have already been recovered and they will help you access them. In cases where they say they will help you recover your funds, they usually call themselves either \""recovery agents\"" or hackers.

When they tell you that your funds have already been recovered, they may impersonate a law enforcement, a government official, a lawyer, or anyone else along those lines. Recovery scams are simply advance-fee scams that are specifically targeted at scam victims. When a victim pays a recovery scammer, the scammer will keep stringing them along while asking for increasingly absurd fees/expenses/deposits/insurance/whatever until the victim stops paying.

If you have been scammed in the past, make sure you are aware of recovery scams so that you are not scammed a second time. If you are currently engaging with a recovery scammer, you should block them and be very wary of random contact for some time. It's normal for posters on this subreddit to be contacted by recovery scammers after posting, and they often ask you to delete your post so that you both cannot receive legitimate advice, and cannot be targeted by other recovery scammers.

Remember: never take advice in private. If someone reaches you in private after posting your scam story, it is because a scammer will always try to hide from the oversight of our community members. A legitimate community member will offer advice in the open, for everyone to see. Anyone suggesting you should reach out to a hacker is scamming you.

"
Refund,"Refund scams usually start with a spam email about a fake transaction, although they can also be sent through SMS or any other messaging service. The message will provide you with a phone number to call if you want to cancel the transaction, and if you call the scammers will try to get you to provide credit card or banking information in order to receive your refund. Scammers have been taking advantage of Paypal's invoice system to send out realistic scam emails through Paypal itself, here is a news article about that technique: https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/08/paypal-phishing-scam-uses-invoices-sent-via-paypal/. Here is a Snopes article regarding the Norton variant of this scam: https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/norton-email-renewal-scam/

If you know someone that fell for a refund scam, sit down together to watch this video by Jim Browning and try to retrace their steps: https://youtu.be/X4PllvUowaQ"
Rental,"Rental scammers usually list apartments at lower than market rate, and will ask for some money up front, or will offer you the keys for money up front. The scammer has no property to rent, and any money you send to the scammer will be lost.

Always tour the place in person with the landlord, property manager or realtor. Never alone, never with an access code, never virtually. Only send deposits and application fees after touring the place, and get a proper receipt for it. Anyone trying to collect money from you without meeting you is a scammer or a shit landlord.

Verify the identity of whoever is touring the place for you. It's always good to check with neighbors to see if the person you're dealing with is legit, or if there's a story behind it. You may learn that this is actually an Airbnb and that a scammer got an access code for it. You may find out the real owner/renter is away on vacation. And if it's a sublet, be informed about it and check with the original landlord to see if it's allowed.

Never sign contracts, or pay deposits, or even application fees/reservation fees without meeting in person first. Never ever send a photo ID or anything not considered public information. Nobody should ask you to pay to reserve your spot without meeting face to face."
Romance,"Romance scammers pretend to be in love with their victims in order to ask them for money. They sometimes spend months grooming their victims, often pretending to be members of military, oil workers or doctors. They tend to be extremely good at taking money from their victims again and again, leading many to financial ruin. Romance scam victims are emotionally invested in their relationship with the scammer, and will often ignore evidence they are being scammed.

If you know someone who is involved in a romance scam, beware that convincing a romance scam victim they are scammed is extremely difficult. We suggest that you sit down together to watch Dr. Phil's shows on romance scammers or episodes of Catfish - sometimes victims find it easier to accept information from TV shows than from their family. A good introduction to the topic is this video: https://youtu.be/PNWM5nuOExI -"
Sextortion,"This scam occurs when you meet a woman/man on dating service/social media site/forum/wherever and they ask you to go on Skype, WhatsApp, Telegram, or another messaging system. They will ask you to exchange naked pictures, and they will usually ask you to include your face in the pictures. They will then threaten to reveal the pictures to your family/friends if you do not pay them. The best thing to do in this situation is block the scammer and go private in your socials for a while. Paying the scammer will not make them back off, and just tells them that it is worth their time to continue threatening you.

If you fell for this scam, we recommend you join the sextortion subreddit and follow the recommendations of their sticky post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Sextortion/comments/n4yorq/new_victims_please_read_first/

Also beware of recovery scammers suggesting you should hire a hacker that can help you retrieve the photos or get back at the extorter. They can't, it's a trick to make you lose more money."
Steam/Discord fake report,"This is a very common scam that happens either on Steam or Discord, or both.

You receive a message from someone claiming that they accidentally reported you, and they will direct you to the profile of a scammer that impersonates a Steam or Discord employee or admin. The other account will then either try to steal your Steam or Discord account. If you encounter this scam, ignore the scammers and report their accounts, including the one that says they accidentally reported you.

Remember: the only way to contact Steam support is clicking here, and the only way to contact Discord support is clicking here.

Here is an example of the scam, here is an article about the scam, and here is Steam's scam page."
Sugar daddy/sugar momma,"Sugar dad/daddy/mom/momma scams are very common and usually come in two varieties: fake check style scams, and advance-fee scams. Fake check style scams involve the scammer making a fraudulent payment to you that will later be reversed, and then you making some sort of payment to the scammer that will not be reversed. Common examples include the scammer sending you a fake check and asking you to buy gift cards, or to send money via Western Union, or to purchase Bitcoins. Another common example involves the sugar scammer offering to pay your bills, or offering you banking information that you will use to pay off your bills. These bank accounts are stolen and the innocent victim will reverse the charge when they notice the fraud.

The second variety of sugar scammers use advance-fee scams, where they offer you money but require you to pay first. They may ask for you to pay them to prove that you are loyal, or they may require you to pay a processing fee. It's common for sugar scammers to send spoofed emails that look like they came from services like PayPal or CashApp that will inform you that you have received money, but that also ask for a processing fee before the funds are released.

In the real world, sugar babies are sex workers that engage in in-person sexual encounters with their clients. We do not recommend that people try to be a sugar baby, but if this is what you are looking into, check out the following subreddits for information on how to be safe: r/SugarLifestyleForum/ and /r/SexWorkers."
Task,"Task scams involve a website or mobile app that claims you can earn money by completing easy tasks, such as watching a video, liking a post, or creating an order. A very common characteristic (but not entirely exclusive) is that you have to complete sets of 40 tasks. The app will tell you that you can earn money for each task, but the catch is that you can only do a limited number of tasks without upgrading your account. To upgrade your accounts, the scammers will require you to pay a fee. This makes it a variant of the advance fee scam.

The goal of this scam is to get people to download the app for easy money and then encourage them to pay to get to the next level. It's impossible to get your \""earnings\"" out of the app, so victims will have wasted their time and money. This type of scam preys on the sunk cost fallacy, because people demonstrate a greater tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment has been made, and refusing to succumb to what may be described as cutting one's losses.

If you're involved in a task scam, cut your losses. Beware of recovery scammers suggesting you should hire a hacker that can help you retrieve the money you already invested. They can't, it's a trick to make you lose more money. Thanks to redditor vignoniana for this script.

Tax,"Tax scams can happen in many forms, such as phone calls with the caller ID spoofed to a real tax number, text messages claiming you have money available to claim, and emails that look like they come from the tax agency. The scams usually involve phishing, but can also involve threatening you and demanding payment immediately, sometimes threatening you with prison time if you do not agree to pay a settlement.

If you see one of these scams, report it to the agency they are impersonating. If you are in the US, and you think you have given enough information (such as a full SSN) and be in danger of having a scammer file a tax return in your name, get an identity protection PIN from the IRS."
Tech support,"Tech support scams can start with the scammer contacting you, through a random phone call, pop-up on a website, notification, or email. You can also run into tech support scams by Googling a support phone number and seeing an advertisement placed by a scammer meant to look like a legitimate support page. To avoid tech support scammers, always ensure you are on the correct website when you're looking for a support number to call. Don't be afraid to hang up and double check if you have called for support but think you may be talking to a scammer. If you're talking to support and they mention anything about gift cards, hang up.

Underage,"This scam usually starts on a dating app and you will encounter a normal woman whose profile says she is above 18. Later you will be contacted and told that the girl is underage. They'll usually pose as the girl's father, another family member, or a police officer. They will tell you that your life will be ruined and you will be a sex offender, but will offer you the chance to pay them to make the problem go away. The stories they use as to why you need to fork over money vary, but the common ones include therapy for the girl, payment for a broken phone or computer, etc.

Of course, there is no girl and no crime has been committed, so if you are involved in this scam all you need to do is ignore their threats and move on with your life. The scammers may contact you again in the future after you block/ignore them, so be ready in case that happens. If you have already sent money to the scammers, you should try to dispute the transaction and see if you can get your money back. This is a very common scam and here are some relevant news articles.

NOTE: Scammers pretend to be underage boys as well and the text above still applies, but it's called the underage girl scam as those are the vast majority of cases."
USPS/Mail scams,"Mail scams (USPS, FedEx, UPS, etc.) are notices sent to your phone or email, claiming that a package has failed to be delivered to your home. The text or email tells you that you need to provide more information or customs fees to receive the package. These scams are phishing for your personal information, financial information, or password for the mail service’s website, or can be trying to get you to pay up front for a service you will never receive. Sometimes the charge is less than a dollar and victims will brush it off, even when realizing they've been scammed. The scammers are not looking to get a dollar out of you, but instead they just stole your credit card details.

If you entered your card details in a website such as this, and submitted the form, even if it said that the transaction failed and to try again with a different card, it doesn't matter: they already stole your card details. You need to call your bank and report the card stolen, and ask the bank representative to disable the automatic account updater service when issuing the new card.

Pay close attention to the specific links you receive, as they will not go to the true website for these mail services. Only enter your information when visiting the mail service’s website directly. For example: USPS only works with usps.com"
Wrong number,"An intentional wrong number text is the entry point to multiple different types of scams. Because these are so prevalent and lead to several unwelcome outcomes (including you confirming you have a live number, leading to more spam/scams), it is recommended that you do not reply to them, even out of courtesy. They hope to take your courtesy, parlay it into a conversation (often by commenting how nice you are and giving some suggestion of fate in meeting this way), and eventually deploy a scam.

If you received a wrong number inquiry that seems to assume a connection with you (e.g. seeking a specific friend, inquiring about a doctor’s appointment, asking about a business correspondence, etc.) and there are no pictures included, then you are likely at the beginning of a crypto scam. Use ! crypto without the space to get more info on crypto scams. You can see a video of this scam develop from wrong number to crypto scam at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ_flb9tGuc

If you receive a random text from a woman that is trying to play up a relationship/hook-up angle and includes an alluring photo, you have encountered what this subreddit often calls the Mandy scam, based on the name used in an early incarnation of it. The replies are sent by a bot and will give the same responses (with some slight variations) regardless of how you respond. The bot also has a few specialized responses that occur when you say words like 'bot' or 'scam'. After a series of replies, it will eventually push you to go to an adult/cam/age verification site. Here are some of the posts on r/scams about the Mandy scam: https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/search?q=mandy&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=relevance&t=all, you can see that the images, names, and scenarios vary. You can report spam texts by forwarding them to 7726 (SPAM): https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-recognize-and-report-spam-text-messages

There is also some evidence that intentional wrong number texts can be part of a data-gathering exercise where each bit of info you give (e.g 'Hi Susan!' and you reply with your name out of courtesy) is collected to be used against you in other scams. Thanks to redditor teratical for this script."
